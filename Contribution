# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

Getting started
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git switch -c feature/your-change`
- Write clear commit messages and small PRs.
- Run tests locally and add tests for new behavior.

Code style
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Keep controllers thin; place business logic in Services.
- Use `@Transactional` for multi-step DB operations.

Pull requests
- Target `main` branch.
- Include description, related issue, and testing steps.
- CI must pass before merge.

Issues
- Create focused issues with steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
- Use labels: `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, `gsoctask`.

Communication
- Follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- For large changes, open a draft PR or discuss on an issue first.
